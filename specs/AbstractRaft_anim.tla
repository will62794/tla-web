\* Action that exchanges terms between two nodes and step down the primary if
\* needed. This can be safely specified as a separate action, rather than
\* occurring atomically on other replication actions that involve communication
\* between two nodes. This makes it clearer to see where term propagation is
\* strictly necessary for guaranteeing safety.
